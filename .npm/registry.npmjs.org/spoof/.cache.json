spoof [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/feross/spoof/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/feross/spoof) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/spoof.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/spoof)\n\n#### Easily spoof your MAC address in OS X & Linux!\n\n![anonymous](img/img.png)\n\nNode.js port of the popular Python utility [SpoofMAC](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpoofMAC/) (GitHub: [feross/SpoofMAC](https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC)).\n\n### why?\n\nI made this because changing your MAC address in OS X is harder than it should be. The Wi-Fi card needs to be manually disassociated from any connected networks in order for the change to apply correctly – super annoying! Doing this manually each time is tedious and lame.\n\nInstead, just run `spoof` and change your MAC address in one command. Now for Linux, too!\n\n### instructions for beginners\n\nHere are some easy install instructions for complete beginners.\n\n1. Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (it's a programming platform like Python, Java, etc.)\n\n2. Open **Terminal**. Let's use Spotlight to find it.\n\n  ![terminal](img/spotlight-terminal.png)\n\n3. Install **spoof** by typing this command and pressing `Enter`.\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo npm install spoof -g\n  ```\n\n  That's it! **spoof** is installed.\n\n3. Now, let's print out the **help page**. Just like before, run this command in **Terminal**.\n\n  ```bash\n  spoof --help\n  ```\n\n4. Now, let's print out all our network devices.\n\n  ```bash\n  spoof list\n  ```\n\n5. Find the device you want to set or randomize the MAC address for in the list. Wi-Fi is usually called `en0` on modern Macs. Then, run this command:\n\n  ```bash\n  sudo spoof randomize en0\n  ```\n\n  You may need to reconnect to the Wi-Fi hotspot you were connected to. But, that's it! Your MAC address is changed. You can confirm by re-running:\n\n   ```bash\n   spoof list\n   ```\n\n### full command list\n\nYou can always see up-to-date usage instructions by running spoof --help.\n\n#### List available devices:\n\n```bash\nspoof list\n- \"Ethernet\" on device \"en0\" with MAC address 70:56:51:BE:B3:00\n- \"Wi-Fi\" on device \"en1\" with MAC address 70:56:51:BE:B3:01 currently set to 70:56:51:BE:B3:02\n- \"Bluetooth PAN\" on device \"en1\"\n```\n\n#### List available devices, but only those on wifi:\n\n```bash\nspoof list --wifi\n- \"Wi-Fi\" on device \"en0\" with MAC address 70:56:51:BE:B3:6F\n```\n\n#### Randomize MAC address *(requires root)*\n\nYou can use the hardware port name, such as:\n\n```bash\nspoof randomize wi-fi\n```\n\nor the device name, such as:\n\n```bash\nspoof randomize en0\n```\n\n#### Set device MAC address to something specific *(requires root)*\n\n```bash\nspoof set 00:00:00:00:00:00 en0\n```\n\n#### Reset device to its original MAC address *(requires root)*\n\nWhile not always possible (because sometimes the original hardware MAC\nisn't available), you can try setting the MAC address of a device back\nto its burned-in address using `reset`:\n\n```bash\nspoof reset wi-fi\n```\n\n(older versions of OS X may call it \"airport\" instead of \"wi-fi\")\n\nOn OS X, another option to reset your MAC address is to simply restart your\ncomputer. OS X doesn't preserve changes to your MAC address between restarts.\n\n### windows support?\n\nIf you need Windows support, consider using the Python version of this program,\n[SpoofMAC](https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC). Or, please send a PR with Windows\nsupport and I'll accept it. You can see [how it's implemented in the Python version](https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC/blob/master/spoofmac/interface.py#L118).\nThanks!\n\n### automatically set my MAC address on startup\n\nIf you want to set your MAC address and have it persist between restarts on\nOS X, consider using the Python version of this program,\n[SpoofMAC](https://github.com/feross/SpoofMAC), and following the instructions\nfor [running automatically on startup](https://github.com/feross/spoofmac#optional-run-automatically-at-startup).\n\n## license\n\nMIT.
